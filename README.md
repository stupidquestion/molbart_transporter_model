# molbart_transporter_model
Repo for transporter models trained by fine-tuning MolBART

The code is housed on Firefly-Lambda machine. Please checkout:
/home/firefly-lambda/Projects/MolBART_utilities/

The code also uses:
/home/firefly-lambda/Projects/MolBART/

You can find the results under:
/home/firefly-lambda/Projects/MolBART_utilities/molbart_results/

I trained this model following the instructions given in the MolBART and MolBART_utilities repositories on company's Github page.
Sorry that I couldn't leave a more detailed list of instructions to train the models. This project was rushed.

Current model results are:
